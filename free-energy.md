### Why are we doing free energy calculations?
The protein-ligand binding free energy gives us
qauntitative insights into the behavior or small molecules,
which is our best bet, at the protein level,
to provide some educated guess about the potency of the compound.

Consider a system
with protein $P$, ligand $L$, and protein-ligand complex $PL$,
with reversible binding behavior:

$$
P + L \rightleftharpoons PL
$$

we are interested in the association coÃ«fficient:

$$

K_a = \frac{[PL]}{[P][L]}.

$$

This can be associated with the Gibbs free energy by

$$

\Delta G_{P + L \rightleftharpoons PL} = -kT \ln K_a

$$


### Definition of free energy

The difference between free energies are simply defined as:
$$
\Delta A_{AB} = A_B - A_A
$$

where $A$ is the Helmholtz free energy:

$$

A = E - TS
= H - PV - TS 
= G - PV.

$$

For each state, we can write:
